The application is used to manage project workflow. The main things possible are creating projects, adding team members, discussion, managing tasks.

# Running

To run the application, download the repository and run "npm run start" from the project-manager/project directory.
The application should automatically open in a new browser tab. 
If there is an error, install dependencies with "npm install".

# Using

New users should sign up with a new account. Main dashboard contains all projects of that particular user. Choosing a project will redirect the user to that project's page with overview, member list, discussion and tasks.
Only project creator can add new members or assign tasks. 
Other options in the sidebar include: 
- Create project
- Invitations (at this moment it only contains incoming invitations to projects)
- Settings (user info, change profile picture)
